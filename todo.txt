ISSUES:
    some appts don't have descriptions
    many arrived but not completed
    some appts have multiple rows
        infend should be the same for all
    --Done
    datetimes different formats
    col names don't match style
    remove notes in file
    some data in wrong col
        ORDER_STATUS, chair, unnamed
        --note: only 11/4

TODO:
    Check all checkin < chairstart < infstart < infend < chairout < checkout
    check if cancelled then no times
    compare infend times for same appt
    look at arrived but not completed
    Make all times datetimes
    Make into SQL database

DONE:
    remove notes; move to new col
    Make all datetime ISO 8601
    rename chair_start to match style
    order status and on; check extra columns
